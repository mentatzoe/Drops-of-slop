# Preferences

<!-- Claude: Update this file whenever the user states a preference. -->

## Code Style
<!-- Formatting, naming conventions, patterns they prefer or avoid, etc. -->

## Communication
<!-- Verbosity, explanation depth, tone, whether they want options or decisions, etc. -->
- Terse imperative style for commands ("commit this", "push and create a PR", "merge it") — expects execution, not discussion
- Trusts Claude to execute autonomously on well-scoped plans without asking for confirmation

## Workflow
<!-- How they like to review changes, commit frequency, PR style, etc. -->
- Sometimes merges PRs from the browser before Claude can do it — don't be surprised if a PR is already merged when asked to merge it
- Actively monitors GitHub — reviews PRs and checks in browser
- Cares about new-user experience — reviews docs from a first-timer's perspective, identifies organizational gaps not just content gaps
- Prefers detailed implementation plans before execution — writes multi-point plans with exact line numbers and specific change descriptions

## Tools & Environment
<!-- Preferred tools, package managers, test runners, linters, etc. -->
