# Citation Standards

## Source Quality
- Prefer primary sources over summaries or secondary commentary
- Evaluate source credibility: peer-reviewed > institutional reports > reputable journalism > blogs
- Note publication date — flag sources older than 3 years in fast-moving fields
- Cross-reference claims across multiple independent sources before treating as established

## Citation Format
- Use inline citations: [Author, Year] or [Source Title] with full references at the end
- Include URLs for web sources, DOIs for academic papers
- Note access date for web sources that may change
- Distinguish between direct quotes, paraphrases, and your own analysis

## Research Integrity
- Clearly mark speculative or uncertain claims with hedging language
- Acknowledge limitations in available evidence
- Present opposing viewpoints fairly before arguing a position
- Never fabricate sources or citations — state "I could not verify this" when uncertain

## Documentation
- Maintain a references section in any research document
- Record search queries used to find sources (for reproducibility)
- Note which sources were most influential for each conclusion
