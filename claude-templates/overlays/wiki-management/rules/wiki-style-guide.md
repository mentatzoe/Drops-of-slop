# Wiki Style Guide

## Article Structure
- Lead section: 1-3 paragraphs summarizing the topic without a heading
- Use hierarchical headings: `==Section==`, `===Subsection===`
- Include an infobox for entities with structured data (characters, locations, items)
- End with See Also, References, and Categories sections

## Writing Style
- Write in third person, present tense for current facts, past tense for historical events
- Use neutral, encyclopedic tone — no first person, no editorializing
- Define jargon on first use; link to glossary entries for technical terms
- Keep paragraphs short: 3-5 sentences maximum

## Linking
- Link to other wiki articles on first mention of a topic within each section
- Don't over-link: common terms (dates, basic concepts) don't need links
- Use piped links for readability: `[[Formal Page Name|display text]]`
- Red links (missing pages) are acceptable — they indicate needed articles

## Categories & Organization
- Every article belongs to at least one category
- Use hierarchical categories: `[[Category:Characters]]` > `[[Category:Characters/Antagonists]]`
- Maintain category pages with brief descriptions of what belongs in each
