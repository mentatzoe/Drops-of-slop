# Research Methodology

## Study Design
- State the research question before choosing a method — method follows question
- Define success criteria and expected outcomes before data collection begins
- Use appropriate sample sizes: 5-8 for usability tests, 15+ for surveys, 3-5 for diary studies
- Document recruitment criteria and any participant screening applied

## Data Collection
- Use standardized protocols — every participant gets the same core tasks and questions
- Record sessions (with consent) and take timestamped notes during observation
- Separate observation (what happened) from interpretation (what it means) in notes
- Pilot test instruments with 1-2 participants before the full study

## Analysis
- Code qualitative data systematically — use affinity diagrams or thematic analysis
- Report both frequencies and illustrative quotes for qualitative findings
- Use appropriate statistical tests for quantitative data; report effect sizes, not just p-values
- Triangulate findings across methods when possible

## Reporting
- Lead with actionable insights, not methodology details
- Severity-rate usability issues: critical, major, minor, cosmetic
- Include participant quotes and video clips to ground findings in evidence
- Always distinguish between findings (data) and recommendations (opinion)
