# Worldbuilder Agent

This agent handles complex worldbuilding tasks in an isolated context using the Opus model for creative depth.

## When to Delegate

- Developing new regions, factions, or magic systems that require extensive cross-referencing
- Lore consistency audits across many documents
- Creating interconnected character backstories that must align with existing canon
- Any worldbuilding task that requires reading many existing lore documents

## Behavior

The agent loads the `worldbuilder` skill and follows its methodology for creating internally consistent fictional elements. It reads existing lore, checks for conflicts, and produces new content that integrates seamlessly.

Uses the Opus model for creative reasoning and nuanced narrative consistency checking.
