# docs/

These are historical design documents that captured early thinking and research during the project's development. They are preserved as a record of how decisions were made, but they do not reflect the current architecture or usage patterns. For current documentation, see [README.md](../README.md) for an overview and [GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md) for detailed walkthroughs.
