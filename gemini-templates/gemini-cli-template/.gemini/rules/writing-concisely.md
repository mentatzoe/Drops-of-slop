# Writing Clearly and Concisely

Whenever you write human prose (READMEs, documentation, commit messages, or UI text), apply these core principles from Strunk's *Elements of Style*.

## Core Principles

1.  **Omit needless words**: Be vigorous and concise. Every word must tell.
2.  **Use active voice**: Avoid weak passive constructions.
3.  **Use definite, concrete language**: Be specific, not abstract.
4.  **Put statements in positive form**: Say what is, not what is not.
5.  **Place emphatic words at the end**: Craft sentences for impact.

## Patterns to Reject (AI "Puffery")

*   **Avoid grandiosity**: Reject words like "pivotal," "critical," "vital," "testament," "enduring legacy," "seamless," "robust," "cutting-edge."
*   **Avoid filler**: Cut empty "-ing" phrases (e.g., "ensuring reliability," "showcase capabilities").
*   **Avoid AI tropes**: Do not use "delve," "leverage," "multifaceted," "foster," "realm," or "tapestry."
*   **Minimal Formatting**: Do not use bolded inline headings for simple lists. Use standard Markdown hierarchy.

## The Goal
Write like a professional engineer: clear, direct, and factual. Do not assume positive or glowing attribution unless strictly cited in source material.
